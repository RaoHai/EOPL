Exercise 1.14

> Given the assumption 0 â‰¤ n < length(v), prove that partial-vector-sum is correct.

proof:

partial-vector-sum is the function:

$$ f(n) =
\begin{case}
  v_0 & n = 0 \\
  v_n + f(n - 1) & n>0
\end{case} $$

Induction hypothesis IH(k) is 

$$ f(n) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}{v_i} $$

when k = 0, IH(k) holds because f(0) = v_0;

when n > k, we have

$$ f(k) = v_k + f(k-1) = \sum_{i=0}^{k}{v_i}$$

IH(k-1) holds
